## Project Information

In this project, the data for member votes of the 117th congress (2021-2023) will be used to display the data of roll call votes that happened. Users can see which party favors a particular bill or nomination, or what a particular senator voted for or against. Users can also perform Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Search operations on the data.

The (planned) creative component of this project is to visualize the data into a graphic form, presumably with javascript and existing libraries.Data from [voteview.com](https://voteview.com/data) will be used. SQL and Python will be used for database management and data analysis. While HTML, CSS, and Javascript will be used for the front-end.
