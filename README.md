# CS-411 Database Systems Project Track 1 Team052-OracleSparrow
Team Members: Michael Cao, Moiz Khan, Tuan Tran, Boyang Yu
## This is a clone of the course project repository.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React.js, CSS, Ant Design Charts, Axios
- Backend: Javasript, HTML, Node.js
- Database: MySQL
- Hosting: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

In this project, we created a functioning full stack web application, with a frontend interface that requests data from a backend Node.js server, which in turn queries the request with the MySQL instance on GCP, and sends the query results back to the frontend for display and visualization.

## Mission Statement
The problem we want to solve is that people may not be aware of how their senators vote, or what bills their party voted for or voted against. We will solve it by showing people the data corresponding to the votes, and analyze the data to show the users what their senators/party voted for.

## Project Summary

In this project, the voting records of Senators from the 117th Congress (2021-2023) is analyzed. This analysis will display the results of roll call votes over the duration of the 117th Congress. Users will be able to query this data in different ways, such as making categories based on Senator political parties, or looking at which roll call votes were favoured by certain parties. Users can also perform Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Search operations on the data, so that the the database can be constantly updated or corrected when inaccuracies are noticed. The user can also change the data to other datasets like the 116th congress.

The data set for this project consists of tables showing all Senators in the 117th Congress, roll call votes that have been voted on, the results of such votes, and the individual votes of Senators for each bill. Senators in the dataset can be identified by their distinct ICSPSR numbers, and roll call votes can be identified by their distinct roll call number.
